## Predicting COVID-19 Mortality Using Machine Learning and Regression Analysis Based on Nutrition Factors

- Project Overview

This research project investigates the relationship between national nutrition patterns and COVID-19 mortality rates across different countries. Developed by Abdullah Sharaf under the supervision of Dr. Alma Rahat during doing MSc Data Science 2023-2034 at Swansea University, this project (Version 0.1 CovidAI) combines data analysis techniques with machine learning approaches using also exaplinable AI to identify significant nutritional factors that may influence COVID-19 case fatality rates.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted over 200 countries worldwide, evolving into both a major healthcare industry concern and a public health emergency. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has caused over 7 million deaths globally, representing approximately 0.09% of the world's 8 billion population. This staggering figure underscores the devastating impact of the pandemic on human life and highlights the urgent need for research into factors that may influence mortality rates.

This project aims to develop robust analytical models to predict COVID-19 mortality rates using machine learning techniques, with a specific focus on nutritional factors. The findings could potentially inform public health decision-making strategies and improve the effectiveness of behavioral change interventions, particularly in educational settings.

- Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main components:

1. Data Analysis Component (Nutrition_KG(DataAnalysis).ipynb): This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between nutritional factors and COVID-19 mortality.

2. Data Science Component (Nutrition_KG(Data_Science).ipynb): This notebook implements various machine learning models to predict COVID-19 mortality rates based on nutritional data, including feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

3. Project Presentation (Nutrition-presentation.pdf): A comprehensive presentation summarizing the project methodology, key findings, and recommendations.
