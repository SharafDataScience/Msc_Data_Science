## Predicting COVID-19 Mortality Using Machine Learning and Regression Analysis Based on Nutrition Factors

- Project Overview

This research project investigates the relationship between national nutrition patterns and COVID-19 mortality rates across different countries. Developed by Abdullah Sharaf under the supervision of Dr. Alma Rahat, this project (Version 0.1 CovidAI) combines data analysis techniques with machine learning approaches to identify significant nutritional factors that may influence COVID-19 case fatality rates.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted over 200 countries worldwide, evolving into both a major healthcare industry concern and a public health emergency. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has caused over 7 million deaths globally, representing approximately 0.09% of the world's 8 billion population. This staggering figure underscores the devastating impact of the pandemic on human life and highlights the urgent need for research into factors that may influence mortality rates.

This project aims to develop robust analytical models to predict COVID-19 mortality rates using machine learning techniques, with a specific focus on nutritional factors. The findings could potentially inform public health decision-making strategies and improve the effectiveness of behavioral change interventions, particularly in educational settings.
